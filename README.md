# SSO-Robot

Just a Openshift (operator like) writen in Node.js to automate Red Hat Single Sign-On deployments and orchestrate configuration/migration of resources.

I wrote this to simplify the process of writing plugins in SSO, with this you *operator* you should be able to write your plugin locally and automate its deployment into a RHSSO instance running on OpenShift. 

You can orchestrate actions like: 

- Deployment of Red Hat Single Sign-On (RHSSO). (Ephemeral or MySQL backed) 
- SPI configuration like Federation/Storage plugins. 
- OpenID authentication using (Direct Grant style), so you can test your plugin. 
- Automate the creation of clients and realms. 
- It does BuildConfig/ImageStream creation for custom RRHSSO image creation. 
- And is easy to extend. 

## Runtimes 

First you need to install the dependencies with:

```
npm install 
```

### OpenShift

This bot is designed to deploy itself into an Openshift, to install it in your cluster:

```sh
sh install.sh gdFfxkC7DEsBOfg... project project-target
```

- **token:** The first parameter is an Openshift token, you can get this token by doing: 

```
oc whoami -t 
# gdFfxkC7DEsBOfg...
``` 

- **project:** Is the project where you want to deploy the bot, just make sure that the ``token`` has priviledge to perform the require actions in that namespace/project.

- **project-target:** Basically configure the bot to have permissions in a particular namespace.

#### Example 

```sh
  sh install.sh gdFfxkC7DEsBOfg... cicd sso-development
```
> Now the bot can deploy RHSSO isntances in the sso-development namespace, if there is a RHSSO already there then its just ignore the command.  

### Local

To use it locally you just need to setup an envrionment variable in your commandline specifying the Openshift server REST API like this: 

Windows: 

```sh
  set OKD_SERVER=https://my-openshift:443
```

Linux: 

```sh
  export OKD_SERVER=https://my-openshift:443
```

And provide the token: 

```sh
 node sso.js deploy create --name=ssso73 --token=my-token --project=hello
```

> When running in a Pod is not necessary to pass the token parameter, the bot takes the container token. 

# RHSSO Resources

This is Node.js extendable command line to automate Red Hat Single Sign-On (RHSSO) deployment configuration, image streams, build configuration, realms creation, clients, authentication (handy to test custom [Keycloak Providers](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/6.0/server_development/#_providers)), etc. 

## Keycloak Actions 

You can pull/post/find/filter the following resources from Keycloak/RHSSO:

- Clients & Clients Secrets
- Federation Plugins
- Realms

### Get

To get a client for example: 

```sh
node sso.js get client --project=sso-dev --url=<https://my-keycloak-instance> --realm=my-realm
[{
  clientId: 'my-client-1',
  rootUrl: '',
  adminUrl: '',
  surrogateAuthRequired: false,
  enabled: true,
}]
```

### Searching

Some cases if you don't remember the name of a particular service you can do a search: 

```sh
node sso.js find client --project=sso-dev --url=https://my-rhsso-server --realm=demorealm --query=clientId=webapp1&enabled=true &&

{
  clientId: 'my-client-1',
  rootUrl: '',
  adminUrl: '',
  surrogateAuthRequired: false,
  enabled: true,
}
```
### Filtering

If you want to pull resources that follow a pattern you can: 

```sh
node sso.js -filter <resource> <url> --key=value
```

Example: 

```sh
node sso.js -filter client https://my-rhsso-server --clientId=my-client

[
    {
      clientId: 'my-client-1',
      rootUrl: '',
      adminUrl: '',
      surrogateAuthRequired: false,
      enabled: true,
    },
    {
      clientId: 'my-client-2',
      rootUrl: '',
      adminUrl: '',
      surrogateAuthRequired: false,
      enabled: true,
    }
]

```


### Migrating Components 

The majority of calls defined above returns a plain ``JSON object``, this is very useful to orchestrate synchronization between different RHSSO environments. 

```sh 
# Import
node sso.js -find storage https://my-keycloak-dev demorealm --name="my-user-federation-spi" > my-spi.json

# Now we can export it to another environment
node sso.js -post storage https://my-keycloak-uat my-spi.json demorealm
```

## OpenShift

Part of its functionality is to also automate the deployment of RHSSO/Keycloak instances in OpenShift, it work best when deployed into a Pod because you can create a [service account](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.6/dev_guide/service_accounts.html) to have a better control of what namespace you can deploy RHSSO. 



## Customization

The command line tool works like this, it takes:

```sh
    node sso.js -<command> arg1 arg2 arg3
```

And the class ```CMD``` basically inject the get the command order ``-command`` and call the function mapped to that field: 

```js
 new CMD({
      <command>: (arg1, arg2, arg3) => YourOwnModule(...arg).DoSomething()
 }).run()
```


### New Parameters 

Also there is the possibility to add parameters like this ones: 

```sh
node sso.js -get resource --name=my_resource --realm=my_realm

```

This makes things easier to remember, you can collect then the values with this: 

```js
 let argss = read_params( process.argv ) // {name: 'my_resource', realm='my_realm'}
```

## Deploying The Bot

This project includes an script to create the BuildConfiguration and the Deployment:

```sh
   sh ./build/create.sh    
```

Next you can locate the pod using ``oc get pod`` and locate a pod that start with ``sso-bot-*``: 

```sh
    oc get pod 

    # NAME               READY     STATUS       RESTARTS   AGE
    # sso-bot-1-hgg2l    1/1       Running      0          9m
```

Remote command execution: 

```sh
    oc exec sso-bot-1-hgg2l -- node sso.js -url https://sso-uat user xxyy my_realm

    #...
    #...
```

## Adding Changes Bot

Once you tested your changes you need to deploy it like this: 

```sh
sh ./build/build.sh
```

This scripts deploy a new version and automatically deploy the new image into a new pod, now you just need to again locate the pod: 

```sh
    oc exec sso-bot-1-hgg2l -- node sso.js -my_new_command arg1 arg2

    #...
    #...
```
